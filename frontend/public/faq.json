        "question":"Does BunnAgain take in animals?",
        "answer": "We are not an open intake shelter, so you cannot bring your rabbits to our facility without approval. We rely on a network of fosters to provide temporary care for rabbits in need. If you are in a situation where you need to re-home your rabbit, please contact us. While we may not be able to take in your rabbit directly, we will be more than happy to share your situation on our social media platforms to help you find assistance."
