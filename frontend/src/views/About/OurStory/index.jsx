          Under the compassionate leadership of President Donna Rome, our
          journey in rescuing rabbits began in 2012, culminating in the
          establishment of BunnAgain Rabbit Rescue in 2015. Our mission revolves
          around the rehabilitation and re-homing of neglected and abandoned
          rabbits, with a concurrent commitment to fostering responsible
          ownership for these often misunderstood animals.
        </p>
        <p>
          At any given time, we provide care for approximately 20 rabbits,
          relying solely on donations to support our cause. Ms. Rome&apos;s
          dedication extends beyond her role, frequently covering veterinary
          care and other essentials out of her own pocket. Committed to advocacy
          and education, she actively engages with the community, participating
          in events ranging from festivals to farmers markets.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of our commitment to responsible rabbit ownership, Ms. Rome
          has instituted a unique &quot;Learn Before You Leap&quot; program.
          This initiative allows prospective owners to explore rabbit ownership
          before formal commitment and facilitates exchanges to ensure optimal
          placements. Beyond rescue efforts, Ms. Rome, who also serves as a
          staff member at a local elementary school, has introduced innovative
          programs like the &quot;bunny box&quot; in the cafeteria, encouraging
          students to donate vegetables that would otherwise go to waste.
          Additionally, the school-wide incentive program, &quot;Breakfast with
          the Bunnies,&quot; exemplifies our holistic approach to fostering
          compassion and responsibility in the community. Join us in making a
          difference in the lives of these adorable creatures and promoting a
          culture of informed and caring rabbit ownership.

          BunnAgain received recognition as a 501(c)(3) non-profit in July 2018.
