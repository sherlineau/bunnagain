            Under the compassionate leadership of President Donna Rome, our
            journey in rescuing rabbits began in 2012, leading to the
            establishment of BunnAgain Rabbit Rescue in 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission revolves around rehabilitating and re-homing neglected
            and abandoned rabbits while fostering responsible ownership for
            these often misunderstood animals.
          </p>
          <p>
            At any given time, we care for approximately 20 rabbits, relying
            solely on donations to support our cause. Ms. Rome&apos;s dedication
            extends beyond her role, often covering veterinary care and other
            essentials out of her own pocket. Committed to advocacy and
            education, she actively engages with the community, participating in
            events from festivals to farmers markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our commitment to responsible rabbit ownership, Ms. Rome has
            instituted a unique &quot;Learn Before You Leap&quot; program. This
            initiative allows prospective owners to explore rabbit ownership
            before formal commitment and facilitates exchanges to ensure optimal
            placements. Beyond rescue efforts, Ms. Rome, who also serves as a
            staff member at a local elementary school, has introduced innovative
            programs like the &quot;bunny box&quot; in the cafeteria,
            encouraging students to donate vegetables that would otherwise go to
            waste. Additionally, the school-wide incentive program,
            &quot;Breakfast with the Bunnies,&quot; exemplifies our holistic
            approach to fostering compassion and responsibility in the
            community. Join us in making a difference in the lives of these
            adorable creatures and promoting a culture of informed and caring
            rabbit ownership.
